# Battleship
This project will mimic the classic board game of battleship. It will be coded in TypeScript, rendered in the browser using HTML, and styled with CSS.
## Game Flow: Setup → Gameplay → Winning the Game

### Step 1: Define the project
What is the project? - This project will mimic the classic board game of battleship. It will be coded in TypeScript, rendered in the browser using HTML, and styled with CSS.</n>
What is the MVP? - the minimal viable product is the game of battleship that renders in web browsers that uses the same exact rules as the board game of battle ship. There should be user input, a game board for each player, functions for playing the game, and feedback from the game if the player has hit a ship or not. (i know this isin’t everything but it is a general idea and how to start off)
What are nice to haves? - clicking a specific tile to shoot at by using a mouse instead of a key on keyboard for user input, sounds, 
When will the project be complete? - the project will be complete when all the MVP objectives are met and the battlefield game board has been properly styled so the players can visually tell what is going on.

### Step 2: Creating the workflow (this will be on the project board on GitHub)
TODO
DOING
DONE
BUGS / NOT SURE HOW TO DO

### Step 3: Breaking down the project into smaller components
Create a 10x10 playing grid - MVP
Create a coordinate system for the grids - MVP
Create the game flow - MVP
Create the game rules - MVP
Create 2 separate players - MVP
Create a fleet of 5 ships for each player - MVP
Take user input for setting up ships on the board - MVP
Take user input for deciding which space to attack - MVP
Game gives feedback for HIT or MISS depending on if player hits or misses the opposing players ship - MVP
Create a frontend UI for both players to use - MVP
